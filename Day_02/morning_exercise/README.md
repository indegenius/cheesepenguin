## Intro
Sass is a CSS pre-processor, meaning it allows you to use some features that don't exist in CSS just yet and compiles it all into usable CSS. For example you can use: nesting, mixins, functions and more! 

- Create a new react app
- install Sass `npm install sass`
- create two files `src/styles.sass` and `src/styles.scss`

## Core Sass Features

- Variables
- Nesting
- Mix-ins
