## Hungry For More

Not only is github great for collaborating (like your group project at the end of this unit), it is now an important part of "DevOps" (Developer Operations).

DevOps usally involved the following:

- Automating the deployment of a project (Continuous Deployment)
- Automating the test of a project (Continuous Integration)
- Containerizing Applications for easy replication (Docker)
- Automating the replication and removing of active containers (Kubernetes)
- Automating the provisioning of cloud infrastructure (Terraform)

Essentially a DevOps engineer takes the app the developers made and make sure it's bug free and runs well for users.

Github is a HUGE part of the toolset for DevOps Engineers, so if you'd like to start learning the principles of this lucrative career path, supplement your learning with this learning lab course:
